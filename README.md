# Harn Webmap Project

## Basic Installation

You need to install _geoserver_ and _qgis_. Depending on the OS you use, installation looks differently. For geoserver, install as described here: https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/installation/index.html

### Debian/Ubuntu

```shell
sudo apt-get install qgis
```

## Data Installation

You then need to get the data zip files. The zip files include some javascript libraries for ease of use. (Have a look at the acknowledgements.) You can get them directly from the projects.
