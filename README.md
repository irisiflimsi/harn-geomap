# Harn Webmap Project

## Basic Installation

You need to install _geoserver_, _qgis_, and a few javascript libraries, including _openstreetmaps_ need to be downloaded. The javascript libraries do not need to be downloaded but can be directly referenced, but that requires CORS to be enabled. Depending on the OS you use, installation looks differently.

### Debian/Ubuntu

```markdown
sudo apt-get install qgis geoserver

## Data Installation

You then need to get the data zip files.
