    <b>Servant's Quarters:</b> The low upper loft of the kitchen is
    the sleeping quarters for the female servants and their
    children. Two domestics and the three kitchen staff members sleep
    here with two children, a 3 year old boy and infant girl. The area
    is cramped but warm in winter and the beds are soft which suits
    the women fine.
