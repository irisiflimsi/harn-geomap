    <b>Sleeping Quarters:</b> Behind the hall is the sleeping area for
    the manor chamberlain, Trent L'sean and his wife, who herself is
    the manor's alewife. Trent is a shrewd man with money and handles
    the manor's budget as well as some of Sir Maild's personally
    attained wealth. Although loyal, Trent has a well controlled
    hatred for Sorakka the Ivinian man-at-arms. Any opportunity to
    insult or embarrass Sorakka is rarely passed on by Trent, a fact
    which entertains Sir Maild.

    The curtained off single bed sleeps the seamstress/dressmaker Tyla
    of Kidaan. Tyla was hired by Sir Maild as a present for his wife
    three months ago, an expense which causes much frustration for
    Trent.
