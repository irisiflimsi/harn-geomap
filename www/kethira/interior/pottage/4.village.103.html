    <b>Solar:</b> Divided into three sections the middle area is a
    sitting area frequented by the ladies of the manor.  The women
    wile away many a day here in conversation, sewing, or engaged in
    other womanly arts seated in fine padded chairs.

    The area to the north sleeps Sir Maild's half-brother Penn and his
    wife. They are childless. Sleeping in the small single bed is
    young Rothen, the four year old son and heir of Sir Maild and Lady
    Erane.

    The southern section is Sir Maild's simply decorated sleeping
    area. A decent bed dominates the area where the lord and his lady
    sleep. A soft single bed sleeps lady Erane's cousin and lady in
    waiting, Neremi. A fine crib sleeps eight month old Sarina,
    daughter of Sir Maild and Lady Erane. The chests hold some of the
    clan's wealth as well as fine clothing and jewelery.
