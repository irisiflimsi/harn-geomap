    <b>Kitchen:</b> The stone kitchen was built separate from the
    manor house in case of fire. The cooking is performed by Akina of
    Telle, a former slave and her two assistants. The back storage
    room has various food stuffs and beverages. The manor lacks a
    decent cold storage area but plans for a new cold cellar are in
    the works.
