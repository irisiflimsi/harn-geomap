    <b>Yard:</b> The inner yard is mostly mud with patches of grass
    about. A chicken coop sits beside the stable and two lavatory
    shacks are situated in the north and south areas of the
    compound. A well sits next to an herb garden cared for by the
    cook. Numerous raised platforms dot the palisade for added
    defence.
