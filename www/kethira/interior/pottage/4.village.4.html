    <b>Outbuilding:</b> This daub and wattle building is used as
    sleeping quarters for visitors. Usually staying here are Sir
    Maild's traveling companions, Sir Yoreth and Sorakka the
    Invinian. Sir Yoreth is Sir Maild's personal priest and sleeps in
    the curtained off bed with the superior locked chest. Sorakka
    sleeps in the other large bed which has a distinct odour of
    vomit. The extra bunks are usually vacant.
