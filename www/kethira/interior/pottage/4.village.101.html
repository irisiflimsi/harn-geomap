    <b>Barracks:</b> The upper level of the gatehouse acts as a
    barracks for the manor's four men-at-arms. The men are treated
    well and are fairly loyal to the ruling clan. An expensive luxury,
    the guards are a necessity given the long absences Sir Maild
    takes. The head man-at-arms is the second son of the village
    reeve.
