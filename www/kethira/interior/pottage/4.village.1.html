    <b>Gatehouse:</b> The entrance into the compound is protected by a
    double gate with murder holes. The western room is a small armoury
    which holds the weapons and shields for the town militia. The
    eastern room is used as a tool shed and storage. A ladder leads up
    to the second level which holds the barracks.
