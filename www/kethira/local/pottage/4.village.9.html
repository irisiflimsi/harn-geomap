    Bjoun is a fine farmer who received five extra acres last year as
    restitution for the rape of his 13 year old daughter by Simadar of
    Fulkne <a
    href="javascript:fly(-24.701846,43.825552,0.000001)">[13]</a>. Although
    he sees the matter as settled he has an understandable disliking
    for Simadar and the reeve makes it a point to keep the men apart.
    Bjoun and his wife have three strong children and also take care
    of his elderly grandmother who is 71 this year, making her the
    oldest person in the fief.
