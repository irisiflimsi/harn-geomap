    Yole is the Fulkne clan head and a talented whittler. His carved
    animals make it into the hands of all village children, many have
    more than one. He remarried last year to a girl 15 years his
    junior and has a baby on the way. Also in his household are two
    older children from his first wife, a son 14 and a daughter
    11. The whole family is exhausted from the lack of sleep because
    of bad dreams.
