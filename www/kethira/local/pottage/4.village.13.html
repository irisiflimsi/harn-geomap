    Half brother to Yole <a
    href="javascript:fly(-24.701956,43.825759,0.000001)">[14]</a>, Simadar
    is unpopular with the women villagers. Last year he was caught and
    convicted of raping the daughter of Bjoun <a
    href="javascript:fly(-24.701620,43.826248,0.000001)">[9]</a>. Publicly
    flogged and fined he now avoids all women except his wife and
    daughter. His family and most men of the village see the matter as
    closed but the older women feel differently, rude gestures are
    common. It was the daughter of Simadar who first started waking up
    in the night screaming from nightmares, she has recently attempted
    suicide.
