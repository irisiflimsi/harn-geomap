    Lamwyne and his voluptuous wife Etty, have the largest family in
    the village with seven healthy children. Although Lamwyne is
    overworked and tired he just can't leave his wife alone and she is
    pregnant yet again. His brother <a
    href="javascript:fly(-24.700419,43.826770,0.000001)">[2]</a> helps
    him as much as he can but Lamwyne is looking forward to his sons
    being strong enough to help in the fields.  At present his oldest
    son is only 10 and little help. The entire family has begun having
    disturbing dreams which they cannot remember.
