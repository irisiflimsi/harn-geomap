    Raena inherited the franchise from his father and now runs it with
    the help of an apprentice and one journeyman. The mill is oxen
    powered due to the stream's poor current but there are plans to
    dam it and build a new mill in the future.  Raena's pregnant wife
    bakes bread in a large oven for the locals with the help of her
    daughters, ages 8 and 10. Raena keeps 10% of the flour he grinds
    which he sells to the manor lord, who in turn sells most of it in
    a larger town.  He is nervous for his family with all the goings
    on in village and is considering going to see a cousin in the
    north for a long visit.
