    Four years ago Dane accidentally killed his wife by dropping a
    mallet from the roof on her head, fracturing her skull. He is
    still racked with guilt and father Habus often visits Dane to
    administer spiritual comfort. Dane has three children who still
    live with him. His 14 year old daughter is betrothed to the eldest
    son of the beadle <a
    href="javascript:fly(-24.700757,43.826403,0.000001)">[4]</a> and is
    to be married next month. Dane and his sons are not looking
    forward to the marriage as none of them are skilled in
    cooking. Dane is looking forward to this years' festival, hoping
    to land a new wife. The household has begun to have nightmares
    with the children waking up screaming.
