    Kalas is a drunkard and a chronic singer, much to the chagrin of
    everyone around him. Friends and family have tried to convince
    Kalas that he can not carry a tune but this has not dampened his
    enthusiasm for song. His three children sing as well but are not
    tone deaf like their father. His tolerant wife and her older
    spinster of a sister round out the household.
