    href="javascript:fly(-24.701616,43.826250,0.000001)">[9]</a> and a
    widow, having lost her husband this past winter. She and her 13
    year old son are surviving but she is looking to remarry. Shoral
    of Hintiem <a
    href="javascript:fly(-24.701727,43.826466,0.000001)">[10]</a> has
    begun visiting Cella which has become popular gossip amongst
    village folk. She experienced her first bad dream last night. Her
    son, who is blessed with a high aura also had a disturbing dream
    but remembers some of it and will share this with the PCs if
    asked. He recalls a beautiful maiden unable to move who is trapped
    in darkness and cold.
