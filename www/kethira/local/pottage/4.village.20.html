    Harlarn is head of a healthy family of six which includes his wife
    and four children between 4 and 13 years. He works for other
    villagers in order to feed his family as his land does not produce
    enough food. Harlarn has requested more land from the lord but has
    yet to receive a response.  His cousin Kalas <a
    href="javascript:fly(-24.701835,43.826702,0.000001)">[11]</a> is his
    best friend and drinking partner, although he does not join his
    cousin in song.
