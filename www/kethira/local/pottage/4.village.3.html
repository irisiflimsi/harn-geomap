    Awal first came to the village in 714 with his wife and two
    children. They are still considered outsiders to the community but
    are making inroads with most. In the last two years Awal has taken
    on two apprentices and two journeymen. Even with the added help
    Awal is terribly busy but his profits are way up so he has started
    giving a little spending money to his apprentices. His eldest
    child is about to be apprenticed to a master a few settlements
    away and his wife is distraught over this. Awal often travels to
    local towns with wagon loads of charcoal, he happily returns with
    certain goods for the other villagers. Harlarn <a
    href="javascript:fly(-24.701986,43.827394,0.000001)">[20]</a> works
    half of Awal's land. Other locals work the other half for a
    portion of the harvest for themselves.
