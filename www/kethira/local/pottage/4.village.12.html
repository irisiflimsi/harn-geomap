    Jerald is the village prankster; sadly for the villagers he is an
    exceptional one. On one occasion he waited two hours dressed as a
    scarecrow in the fields until the reeve passed by to scare
    him. His wife is mortified by her husband's antics and feeds him
    cold pottage after every prank but this is just a price he pays
    for his art. When their mother is not around his three children
    love to share in their father's jokes and encourage him.
