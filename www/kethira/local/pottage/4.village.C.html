    <b>Church of Peoni</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Lady Erane is a devout Peonian and convinced her husband to
    construct a new cottage and tithe barn for the Peonian church. The
    ebasethe (priest), father Habus, holds services at an outdoor
    shrine or in the barn on days with poor weather. A small graveyard
    is present on church land as well as a tiny orchard. In addition
    the church holds 60 acres of fields tended by the villagers.
    There are plans to construct a small temple in the village but
    funds are lacking at the present time or so Sir Maild says.
