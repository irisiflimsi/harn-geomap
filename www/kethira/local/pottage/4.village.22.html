    Fifty-two-year-old Konaras is still able to work his 40 acres with
    ease with the help of his eldest son. He has been reeve of the
    village for 23 years and is respected by all. He and his wife take
    care of two adopted orphans in addition to their son,
    daughter-in-law and two grandchildren. His second son is a guard
    at the manor house. He is angry with what is happening in the
    village as the lord is not here to defend his people and worse, he
    does not understand what is going on.
