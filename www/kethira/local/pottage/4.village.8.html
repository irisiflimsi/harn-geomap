    Drod has brown eyes so dark they appear black giving him an
    unsettling appearance. He is cousin to Yole <a
    href="javascript:fly(-24.701954,43.825760,0.000001)">[14]</a> and is
    married to the daughter of the reeve. They have two children, a
    six year old son and daughter, who's three. Recently this family
    has begun to experience nightmares with the children waking in
    tears, Drod has much anger towards the lord for abandoning his
    duties.
