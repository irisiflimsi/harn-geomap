    Shoral was adopted into clan Hintiem as a child; he now counts
    Dynis <a
    href="javascript:fly(-24.701391,43.825781,0.000001)">[7]</a> and
    Galeman, the beadle as brothers. His wife died years ago but has
    four surviving children between 6 and 16 years. Shoral's 14 year
    old daughter has gotten herself pregnant but cannot or will not
    say who the father might be, many suspect Sorakka at the manor.
