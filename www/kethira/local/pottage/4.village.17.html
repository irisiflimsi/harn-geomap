    Largo is a small unattractive 16 year old young man with red hair
    and a rat-like face. He has no illusions about his appearance and
    knows if he is to get a wife he must prove himself a good
    provider. Hard working with a good sense of humour has endeared
    him to the older women of the village but so far has been below
    the notice of the few girls of marrying age. He has cared for his
    near deaf mother since the disappearance of his father two years
    ago.
