    Galeman has been the village beadle for five years and is well
    liked by the manor lord. The beadle carries a stout staff with him
    at all times, more than a few villagers have felt it across their
    backs. He is the head of his clan and a rigid man, disliking
    slackers. His wife and three children complete this household; his
    oldest son is set to marry the daughter of Dane of Chetrik <a

    has a very intelligent Kaldorin (sheepdog) named Majesty who is
    his constant companion. Many remark that the dog is smarter than
    most villagers, probably true.
