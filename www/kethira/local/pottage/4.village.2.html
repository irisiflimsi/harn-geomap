    Sarathid is a widower having lost his wife to pneumonia last
    winter. His two young children are watched by his mother who lives
    with them. Sarathid helps out his brother Lamwyne frequently <a
    href="javascript:fly(-24.702174,43.826197,0.000001)">[16]</a> but is
    beginning to get a little resentful, feeling maybe Lamwyne should
    control his lust a bit more.
