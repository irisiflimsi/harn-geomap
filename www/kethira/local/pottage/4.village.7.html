    Dynis has walked with a slight limp since childhood when an ox
    crushed his foot. He and his brother the beadle look so much alike
    that many mistake them for each other. His youngest son was killed
    last year by a bear which was then slain by the manor lord. Dynis
    has the bear pelt on his wall as a trophy despite the objections
    of his wife. He has three surviving children ages seven to
    fourteen. The family has been having bad dreams for days.
